**Chat-bot** is a custom web component built with three core components: **chat**, **chat-bubble**, and **chat-loading**.

- The **chat** component serves as the main container, displaying an illustration when there are no messages and providing layout adjustments when the user submits a prompt.
  
- The **chat-bubble** component represents the messages exchanged between the user and the assistant, visually illustrating the conversation.

- The **chat-loading** component displays a loading indicator, providing feedback while the assistant is processing or generating a response.
