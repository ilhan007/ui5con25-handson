# Develop `Chat` web component

Time for the fun part! As you code, the development server will automatically refresh the index.html page so you can instantly see your changes.

## 1. Create `Chat` we component

Use the `create-ui5-element` command to generate the Chat.

```sh
npm run create-ui5-element Chat
```

This command will generate the following files:

- src/Chat.ts – The TypeScript class that defines the component logic
- src/ChatTemplate.tsx – The JSX-based template for the component
- src/Chat.css – The CSS file for styling the component
